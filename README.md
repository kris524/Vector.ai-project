# Day 1:

Hello, I wanted to say that I have never used React and this is my first time using it. I have followed tutorials online and It seems that I managed to print the data on a web app. I used npm start on my cmd and the main application is App.js. I will continue working on this first part.

# Day 2:

I managed to build a table but each data type head is under another. I managed to add an image of a cat under each type as well. My plan is to make a list of cat images and iterate over them as I have done with the data type, I will also decrease the images size or increase the font of the titles
